            <!-- <h2 id="hello">Hi my name is Tiffany!</h2> -->
            <p id="words">Hello! I’m a passionate software engineer with a strong desire 
                to continually expand my knowledge and make a positive impact on both my 
                local community and the world at large. I’m a recent graduate of UC Davis, 
                where I honed my skills in computer science and developed a deep interest 
                in coding, problem-solving, and building meaningful technology solutions. 
                As I transition into the software engineering industry, I am excited to 
                apply my technical skills to real-world projects and work collaboratively 
                with talented teams to create innovative solutions. I’m driven by the 
                opportunity to continuously learn, tackle new challenges, and make a 
                tangible impact through technology. I look forward to the journey ahead 
                and am eager to contribute to projects that can help shape the future.
