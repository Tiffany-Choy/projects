                <p id="text">As a Computer Science Instructor at Juni Learning, I taught both foundational and advanced computer 
                    science concepts to students aged 8-18 through one-on-one sessions on zoom. I designed and delivered 
                    customized lesson plans covering a range of topics including programming languages like Python, Java, C++, 
                    HTML/CSS, and Javascript, as well as algorithms, data structures, and computational thinking. I provided 
                    clear explanations and guidance, helping students develop critical problem-solving skills, understand 
                    coding logic, the ability to debug their code, and successfully complete coding projects. By assessing 
                    student progress through assignments, quizzes, and projects, I offered detailed feedback to foster growth 
                    and improve coding proficiency. My approach was to motivate and engage students in a positive and supportive 
                    manner, cultivating a passion for coding. I adapted my teaching methods to accommodate diverse learning styles, ensuring 
                    that every student could progress at their own pace. Additionally, I maintained open communication with 
                    parents to provide regular updates on student progress and discuss areas for improvement. I also kept 
                    myself up-to-date with the latest trends in computer science education and contributed to the 
                    development of course materials and curriculum improvements to enhance the learning experience for 
                    future students.
